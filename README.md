# ISC'7 datasets

This repository contains the dataset which are used in the keynote paper on Machine learning tools for the treatment of offshore site investigations. The paper is authored by Bruno Stuyts, staff member of OWI-Lab (Geotechnical Laboratory at UGent, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Sirris).

These datasets are provided in the public domain to allow geotechnical engineers to practice the machine learning techniques described in the paper.

The original datasources for the datasets are provided below:

   - Downhole_cpt_data.xlsx: Downhole CPT data used for the ISFOG2020 data science prediction exercise, provided by Cathie Group
   - PEZ_alldownhole.xlsx and PEZ_allseabed.xlsx: Seafloor and downhole CPT data from the Princess Elizabeth Zone, provided by the Belgian Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs (FOD Economie). The data sharing platform for the Princess Elizabeth Zone can be found here: https://offshore.digital-database.economie.fgov.be/#/home
   - S-PCPT dataset.xlsx: Shear wave velocity measurements from S-PCPT testing and associated CPT features from S-PCPT testing performed for the Dutch governments (https://offshorewind.rvo.nl/). The data is provided by RVO under a Creative Commons license. The combination of CPT and S-PCPT data has been performed by OWI-Lab.
